# -REST_API-MongoDB-Swagger-Springboot

I am practicing using REST API using MongoDB and Swagger.

You will need Tomcat installed along with the others that are explained.

To get MongoDB localhost connection, please watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLdHHa2XS8M

To access the Swagger Documentation, after you run the Spring Boot Application, please go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html 

I used this guide: https://www.javaguides.net/2019/12/spring-boot-mongodb-crud-example-tutorial.html in order to create my code, except I made modifications to the code because I am currently trying to learn how REST API is coded. Additonally I made the Documentation is cleaner compared to the one in the javaguides website.
